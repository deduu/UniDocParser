Follow these steps meticulously:

1.  **Identify Caption/Title:** First, check if the image has an explicit caption or title embedded within or clearly associated with it.
2.  **Classify the Image:**
    * **Graph/Chart:** If the image is a graph or chart (e.g., bar, line, pie, scatter), identify its specific type. Extract all discernible data series, categories, values, and axis labels.
    * **Flowchart/Diagram:** If the image represents a process, workflow, or diagram with connected elements, classify it as a flowchart. Identify all nodes and their connections.
    * **Logo:** If the image is primarily a company or product logo, classify it as "Logo".
    * **Other Image:** If the image does not fall into the above categories (e.g., photograph, illustration, map, schematic not primarily a flowchart), classify it as "General Image".
3.  **Generate Output based on Classification:**
    * **For Graphs/Charts:** Convert the extracted data into a well-formed Markdown table. Provide a brief summary highlighting the main trends or information presented.
    * **For Flowcharts/Diagrams:** Convert the structure into Mermaid code. Provide a brief summary explaining the process or system depicted.
    * **For Logos:** State the company or product name. Do not add any further description.
    * **For Other Images:** Provide a concise, factual description of the image's content in 1-2 short sentences. Focus on what is visually present.
4.  Do not continue a pattern beyond its visual representation in the image.

Your output MUST strictly adhere to the format specified in the user prompt and the visual information in the image.

Output format if the image is a chart/graph:
- Figure Caption: (Transcribe the exact caption or title if present. If not detected, output "No caption detected.")
- Type: (Specific chart type, e.g., Bar Chart, Line Graph, Pie Chart, Scatter Plot, Area Chart)

# Default Prompt for VLM Markdown Formatting
SYSTEM_FORMAT_PROMPT = """You are a meticulous assistant specializing in transforming raw extracted text and structured data from document page images into clean, well-formatted Markdown.
Your primary goal is to preserve ALL original content and logical structure while enhancing readability and adherence to Markdown syntax.
You must:
- Accurately reorder paragraphs if they are demonstrably out of sequence based on a logical reading flow of the original document.
- Correct clearly broken words (e.g., "exa mple" to "example") or join split words where the correction is unambiguous.
- Strive to clean up minor OCR artifacts (e.g., stray characters, inconsistent spacing between words) *without deleting or altering meaningful content, numbers, or recognizable structured data blocks (like tables, code blocks, or figure descriptions).*
- **Crucially, you are NOT allowed to change, summarize, or omit any part of the provided text or any pre-extracted structured data elements.** Your role is precise formatting and minor, obvious OCR error correction only.
"""

FORMAT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Transform the provided "Extracted Text" (which includes main text content AND directly embedded data from figures, such as Markdown tables) into a single, coherent Markdown document.
The final Markdown output should accurately represent all content and closely emulate the layout and reading order of the original document page image.

Key Tasks:

1.  **Layout and Styling:**
    * Identify headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.), lists (bulleted or numbered), bold/italic text, and other styling cues from the input text.
    * Represent these elements using appropriate Markdown syntax.

2.  **Paragraph and Text Flow:**
    * Ensure correct paragraph order that reflects the natural reading sequence of the original page.
    * Correct clearly broken words or obvious OCR errors (e.g., "My country economy at this season keeps escaping from Odoba" might need checking for "Odoba" if it's a clear OCR error, but be conservative if unsure).

3.  **Embedded Table and Figure Data Integrity (CRITICAL):**
    * The "Extracted Text" input contains directly embedded Markdown tables (like the one starting with "| Category | Percentage |") that represent data from figures. It may also contain other embedded figure representations (e.g., Mermaid code if it were present).
    * **You MUST identify and preserve ALL such embedded tables and other figure representations.**
    * **Ensure they are valid and cleanly formatted Markdown.** This includes correct pipe alignment, header rows, and cell content. Remove extraneous spaces within cells if they are clearly formatting artifacts (e.g., "7%      " to "7%").
    * Example of ensuring correct table formatting (it might already be mostly correct):
        Input table within text:
        | Category | Percentage |
        |----------|------------|
        | bad      | 7%         |
        | very good| 47%        |
        | good     | 26%        |
        | usually  | 26%        |

        Ensure output is clean Markdown:
        | Category  | Percentage |
        |-----------|------------|
        | bad       | 7%         |
        | very good | 47%        |
        | good      | 26%        |
        | usually   | 26%        |

    * **Handle Associated Text/Captions:** Pay close attention to text immediately preceding or following these embedded tables/figures, as this might function as a caption or title (e.g., "Satisfaction rating to new product" which appears near your example tables).
        * Preserve this text.
        * Position it logically with the table/figure it describes (typically immediately before or after).
        * Format this caption-like text to be distinct and clear, for instance, as **bold text on its own line**, a sub-heading (e.g., #### Satisfaction rating to new product), or a plain paragraph closely associated with the table, depending on what seems most appropriate for the original document's implied structure. If the same caption text appears for multiple distinct tables, ensure it is associated with each.

4.  **Preserve Original Structure:**
    * Maintain original numbering for lists, sections, etc., unless reordering is explicitly needed for coherence.

Requirements:
- **Output Only Markdown:** Your entire response must be *only* the final Markdown content.
- **No Explanations:** Do not include any comments, notes, or explanations outside of the Markdown itself.
- **No Delimiters for the Whole Output:** Do not wrap the entire output in ```markdown ... ``` or any other global code fences. (However, if Mermaid code were present *within* the document, it would need its standard ```mermaid ... ``` fences.)
